Blackjack by Ronnie Villarini

This is a simple blackjack program built with JavaScript and styled using bootstrap4. This program was built as part of a course found on Pluralsight.com.
I added styling, and intend to add more functionality to the game as time goes on.

If you've never played blackjack before, the rules are simple, you must get 21 or as close to it without going over.
-The dealer and the player are both dealt two cards.
-The cards are totaled into points 10-K are worth 10 points, Aces are worth either 1 or 11, and 1-9 are worth their respective card number in points.
-The player may "hit" (take another card) or "stay" (do not draw anymore cards).
-Once the player stays, the dealer will draw until either they "bust" (go over 21) or win.

After the game is finished, you may play another.
